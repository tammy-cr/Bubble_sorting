!Iâ€™m asking the user to type the name of a file. 
!I skip the first line in file because the first line has a sentence. 
! B is used as an index of A. So B is not a real but it is an allocatable integer. 


implicit none

real, allocatable :: A (:)
real :: Temp
integer :: i, j, n
character (len=50) :: InFile


print*, "What is your file?"
read(*,*) InFile !asks the user to type file name
open(42,file=InFile)
read(42,*) ! This skips a line in the file

open (10, file= 'Num1.txt')

 do i=1, n
   read (10, *) A (i)
